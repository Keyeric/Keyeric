## Full Stack Software Developer In Training

Hi guys! My name is Key (like a house key) and I'm a developer.  
My code passion lies with technologial advancements and helping push the world into the future we see in The Jetsons  
Now that we've got the obvious out of the way, a little about myself: 

- ‚ö° **_Pronunciation_**: Key - air - ick  
_I hate having to put this here but 24 years on this planet tells me I have to. It is pronounced, the way it is spelled._
- I'm a media specialist, with experience in photography, videography and some light audio work  
(I've also worked professionally using a Blackmagic Design ATEM Televison Studio Pro HD)  
I also have my own youtube channel that I have to get better at doing consistently.
- I am, as the kids say, a hardcore Gamer. I enjoy RPG titles the most but I'm not against kicking back with an FPS every once in a while.
- My favorite hobbies are roller skating and playing trumpet.  
As far as qualifications go, I have skated since I was around 7, even worked at Sonic Drive In for a bit,  
and I marched in **Southern University and A&M College's _Human Jukebox_ Marching Band**, one of (_if not the_) the best HBCU Marching Bands in the _world_.
